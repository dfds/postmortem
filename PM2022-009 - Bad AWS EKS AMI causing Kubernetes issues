# Bad AWS EKS AMI 

## Summary

On Monday our daily-rollover process spawned new nodes based on the latest AWS EKS-node AMI which was later recalled due to a Kernel 
issue. This bad node image caused sporadic communication issues in our cluster, notably nodes briefly reportng "PLEG is not healthy" and 
occasionally reporting as unhealthy. One team also reported network timeout issues from their deployed pods communicating with other services.

The issue was resolved by rolling the EC2 AutoScaling group launch configuration's AMI image to the previous known good version.

## Timeline

All times in UTC.

| Time             | Event                   |
| :--------------- | ----------------------- |
| 2022-10-29 01:02 | AMI v20221027 released |
| 2022-10-31 07:30 | Daily roll-over of nodes picks up new latest AMI image and replaces existing nodes with new nodes based on AMI v20221027 |
| 2022-10-31 13:45 | A planned upgrade of the vpc-cni eks-addon is triggered via deployment pipeline |
| 2022-10-31 14:10 | Pipeline reports failure as it times out performing the upgrade. We observe only ~10 of 45 aws-node pods have successfully upgraded, 5 are stuck in terminating and the remaining 30 have not been attempted  |
| 2022-10-31 14:30 | We observe some nodes reporting NodeNotReady for ~30 seconds at a time before reporting NodeReady again, reporting "KubeletNotReady PLEG is not healthy". Assumed this was in some way related to the in-progress upgrade of vpc-cni/eks-nodes |
| 2022-10-31 14:50 | Some pods eventually make progress and successfully upgrade their eks-node but eventually become stuck again |
| 2022-10-31 15:15 | We attempted to force delete a terminating pod and observed that it created a new one but it did not become Ready |
| 2022-10-31 15:45 | Begin manual intervention to cordon, drain and delete remaining "stuck in eks-node terminating" nodes one at a time to complete vpc-cni upgrade |
| 2022-10-31 16:45 | Logs investigated on nodes for clues but nothing obvious found. No logs were available from the Kubernetes API for some containers but the aws-node containers were running and logging on the node itself. Logs downloaded from node for future reference |
| 2022-10-31 17:21 | An issue is found on GitHub re: AMI v202201027 PLEG which leads us to find that v202201027 has been recalled due to a Kernel issue. |
| 2022-10-31 17:35 | All aws-node pods upgraded and in running state, 15 nodes had to be drained and deleted in total. |
| 2022-10-31 17:45 | NodeNotReady events still occuring but no loss of service has been detected or reported and otherwise the cluster has been operational. Decision made to re-assess tomorrow |
| 2022-11-01 09:30 | No signs of service interruption so decision made to monitor for the day with a view to wait for a new AMI release while bearing in mind we may need to roll-back the AMI if any issues become apparent |
| 2022-11-01 11:12 | Observed that the number of sockets used per node is continuously increasing |
| 2022-11-02 08:56 | Issue raised to modify our infrastructure-modules terraform to allow setting of a specific AMI as it is hardcoded to use latest |
| 2022-11-02 10:52 | A team reports they are having connectivity issues from some of their pods but do not provide any further information for us to investigate the specifics |
| 2022-11-02 11:56 | Decision made to roll back AMI due to increasing socket issues and Kubernetes events reporting communication problems |
| 2022-11-02 13:14 | Work on terraform complete and tested, merged into master branch |
| 2022-11-02 13:46 | Pipeline ran and nodes rolled back to previous AMI |
| 2022-11-02 14:40 | After observation we decided that the AMI rollback had resolved the issue |

## Contributing Factors

- Difficulty getting a response from the team that did report an issue about specifics
- No on-call escalation paths with individual teams
- Some deployed team applications not using readiness/liveness probes
- Happened during an IT conference where most of the development teams were away
- Our infrastructure-modules were hard-coded to use the "latest" AMI as soon as it is available as part of daily roll-over with no function to pin a specific AMI
- EKS component upgraded the same day as a new node AMI was used confused matters
- Alerting not catching NodeNotReady/Sockets
- Lack of deeper understanding of Kubernetes components in the team

## Action Items

- Improve coverage of readiness/liveness probes
    - Reach out to teams with suggestions about readiness/liveness probes
    - Create dashboard  for readiness/liveness probe coverage
    - Create wiki article covering readiness/liveness probes and their usefulness
- Modify infrastructure-modules to allow specifying a particular AMI
- Schedule a discussion about whether we should immediately receive "latest" AMI and how we would go about testing new AMI's before they are deployed
- Implement alerting to catch abnormal NodeNotReady events and/or increased sockets used
- Create a learning path for Kubernetes within the team
- Collect logs from nodes centrally
- Create a Prometheus exporter that retrieves the latest AMI available and create associated dashboard/alerts

## Lessons Learned

- If a new AMI has been deployed, be very cautious about upgrading components on the same day
- We need better communication paths with teams for incidents/issues
